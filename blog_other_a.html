        <h1 class="heading-one">Capitalist Creativity</h1>
        <p class="blog-paragraph">
          Gill and Pratt (2008) have highlighted that a class within the global
          sphere of entrepreneurs has emerged, and it is one assembled by
          creatives, mostly digital, such as artists, content creators,
          designers and the like. The creative class has risen with the
          exponential nature of technology and the digitilisation of the
          workplace. This essay will aim to define and situate the creative
          class as they have been deemed “model entrepreneurs” (Gill & Pratt
          2008: 2) and then highlight the effects that the labour of the
          creative class undergoes within capitalism, digitilisation and the
          advancement of technology. It will then conclude with possible ways in
          which the creative class may free themselves from the effects and
          inflictions of neoliberal capitalism.

          Changes in modern societys workplaces are eminent and ever growing.
          They are accompanied, or perhaps propelled, by an incessant need for
          labourers to rapidly and adaptively learn new technologies to keep up
          with industry standards. These labourers form a mostly digital or
          online workforce whose prerequisite into the online industry is
          creativity; the ability to be creative and think and work creatively.
          Gill and Pratt (2008: 3) define these labourers as “cultural and
          creative workers” who form a creative entrepreneurial class; model
          entrepreneurs who have been identified by governments and industries
          as an easily exploitable workforce because of their subjectivity to
          unstable and lawfully ill-supported career paths. It is in the
          governments and the industries favour to manifest such a workforce as
          accountability, risk and responsibility fall entirely on the single
          creative labourer (Gill & Pratt 2008: 4). This individuality also
          promises a disunity within the class, however that will be addressed
          later. Gill and Pratt (2008: 2) situate the creative class as “centre
          stage” perhaps because of their most telling attributes of modern-day
          capitalism. They identify them as the latest precariat that expose the
          subtleties of capitalisms and neoliberalisms inflictions of
          instability and disunion. Creative labourers, the precariat, under a
          critical lens find themselves at the epicentre of labour exploitation
          and as Gill and Pratt (2008: 4) posit, possible “new political
          subjectivity.”

          This essay will reflect on a portion of the creative class that is
          made up of digital and online workers; anyone whose career or form of
          income comes from their online persona. For example, a musician whose
          music is on Soundcloud but has minimal or no compensation due to not
          being signed with a company. A graphic designer who receives
          employment based off clients viewing their online portfolio through
          Instagram. The underpinning attribute of these scenarios is the
          precariousness of employment. However, the creative class is misled by
          being sold the ideology of freedom through creative work; the creative
          is free to work as and when they please as opposed to a rigid status
          quo job (Leary 2018: 30). The creative is told they are following
          passion which means they should overlook the free labour that
          employers, industries, and even government exploit. The graphic
          designer who uses Instagram as a professional platform enables
          Instagrams profits through the interactions a post will gain. The
          time, effort and energy, the free labour Instagram exploits, that goes
          into producing content the designer can post goes unpaid. Nor can it
          be billed once or if they receive a commission. Time, effort and
          energy can be understood as “immaterial labour” (Gill & Pratt 2008).
          They are attributes that are not regarded as work yet still produce
          something consumable.

          A capitalist notion found within the creative class online workplace
          is what Casilli (2017: 3943) explains as “platform capitalism”. It has
          an intrinsic link to the class subjectivity to government rule and
          politics. The precariat is subjected to the “social dynamics of
          marginalisation and disempowerment” (Casilli 2017: 3943) as the
          pattern of their cheap or unpaid labour aligns with the paradigm of
          low-cost labour found through gendered or racialised minority groups.
          Platform capitalism sees the creative labourer as similar to the
          minority labourer for various reasons; the lack of lawful and monetary
          support or accepting underpaid or even unpaid (such as an internship)
          employment and the shared “insecure forms of living” (Gill & Pratt
          2008: 5). Platform capitalism is a liked political agenda as it
          inflicts ways to subdue and divide the creative class. The division
          comes partly in the form of competition. A content creators social
          media must be more active, have more views and likes than their
          competitors for them to receive the job instead. Organising and
          uniting may be unfavourable. A small example of this effect was seen
          in the making of Click; a group of six Australian YouTubers who banded
          together to create content. They went as far as to move in with each
          other, but over time separated due to it being difficult to make new
          and authentic content while they were constantly around each other.
          Though this is not an example of an organised union, it does portray
          why content creators are encouraged to stay individual; their content
          is personal and unique and their success can thus be owed to
          themselves. Finally, the creative class find themselves at the mercy
          of the unpredictable essence of their online workplaces. Not only is
          employment inauspicious, but the workspaces are precarious too. The
          upgrades platforms make to their software inflict “labor requirements
          of online persona management” (Scolere et al. 2018: 7) that constantly
          call for the creative class to readjust. The creative class must put
          in more time and effort into learning or rethinking strategies to stay
          accessible and relevant within the platform. There are little to no
          laws regulating platform updates. An illustrator who once got majority
          of their interactivity through feed posts may see a dip when Instagram
          implemented stories and reels in an update. The illustrator must now
          learn new ways to produce and publish content to gain the same and
          more interactivity they had before. There are no regulatory laws that
          protect the illustrators labour, or more so, their immaterial labour.

          The anti-capitalist theories of Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri are
          pulled into the argument as their belief is that creative “workers use
          of technology exceeds the capacity of capital to control” (Gill &
          Pratt 2008: 12) them offer ways in which Autonomous Marxism
          potentially overthrows capitalism. As this essay focused on the
          inflictions of neoliberalist capitalism on the creative class, the
          model entrepreneurial pedestal they have been put on, perhaps a
          jumpstart to change the discourse is for the class to become aware and
          well versed in their role within society; what they could do to better
          support themselves and the class as a whole.
