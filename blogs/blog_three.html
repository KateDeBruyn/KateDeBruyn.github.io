        Design Metaphors in and for digital information
      </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        In any instance of processing digital information, User Interface and
        User Experience form an integral part. Within their design lie metaphors
        - key elements, like concepts, terms and images, that represent data in
        order for a user to comprehend, consume, recall and command (Marcus
        1998, pp 129). These elements can be portrayed through actions,
        procedures and/or images and also exist to utilise prior knowledge so
        that a user may instantaneously understand the information presented by
        the interface (The Audiopedia 2017).

        Using metaphors to understand digital information
      </h3>
      <p class="paragraph">
        Humans are always processing information. As I type this, I am drawing
        my ideas and thoughts from the literature I have just engaged with in
        order to write a reflection on it; I am processing information I've just
        come across in order to execute another process where I can reflect on
        the information. On top of that, there is the process of thought to
        type; I am processing my thoughts and opinions through the act of
        typing. On top of that, the machine I am typing on is also undergoing
        its own process in order to show me the letters that I'm typing on a
        screen, so I am processing how the words are coming across the screen
        too. This is just one out of many avenues of processing information.
        Humans also process information through organisation. Association is one
        way in which information can be organised in order to understand, and
        design metaphors enable us to do this. We can draw on a key element such
        as 'attribute' show this process. Humans give people, objects, places,
        events, and so on, attributes in order to understand them. WIRED (2014)
        touches on this idea by illustrating studies that have shown how
        physical warmth can link to emotional warmth. Warmth is an attribute
        humans may give to a fire or a jersey. But warmth is also an attribute
        they may give to someone's voice or a feeling. A studied showed that
        romantic movies were more sought after during a cold front - these
        people were finding the emotional warmth in romance in order to combat
        the physical lack of warmth from the weather. And as a result, an
        association about romantic movies and cold weather can be made, the
        association being that of warmth. How does this metaphor help process
        information? It is possible that viewers may pay more attention to the
        movie because the setting and context it is being watched in is 'right'.
        Thus, the information from the movie is being better comprehended and
        consumed. Perhaps even the controls, the User Interface, of the
        streaming platform, or the DVD's settings were even easier to grasp
        because of the favorable condition they were being engaged in. As Marcus
        (1998:128) states, "metaphors may achieve their effectiveness through
        associations of organization" but it is important to know how these
        associations are formed and what kinds of information they organise.
        Using design metaphors in something like User Interface, helps a user to
        understand digital information. It is also a good place to highlight the
        importance and use of pre-existing knowledge. How did humans come to
        understand digital technology? This may be a far-fetched opinion, but
        perhaps it started with the invention of electricity as many of our
        digital technologies depend on it. Without taking too deep of a dive
        into the historical nuances of "digital", "technology", and "digital
        technology", electricity and electrical inventions date as far back as
        600BC. However, it is only around 1925 that electrical inventions made
        their way into user's homes - this being the type of lightbulb that
        Thomas Eddison invented nearly 40 years prior (National Park Service
        2015). I would like to imagine that this is possibly where most humans
        (users) began to learn that an electrical switch turns something
        electric on and off. This action can situate itself in the sets of
        functions that are verbs in visual-verbal communication (Marcus), most
        likely within select or evaluate. Learning how a light switch functions
        means that humans can use that knowledge when they come across other
        perceived switches. We learn that switch indicates a state change. Even
        though it is a button click different to a traditional light switch, we
        learn how to switch a device on or off. An on/off switch or button on a
        device is part of its User Interface design and communicates digital
        information (turning on or shutting down a system). This is a
        fundamental concept (on or off), sometimes even with the use of imagery,
        that makes the system's information (can use or cannot use)
        comprehensive to the user, in other words, a design metaphor.
