            Dependency Research and the Animate.css Library
          </h1>
          <h2 class="heading-two">Initial Research</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            For this exam, we had the task of researching and using an external
            JavaScript Dependency or Library to improve the usability and/or
            functionality of the site. I had to begin with researching what all
            of that meant. From what I understand now, a JavaScript Dependency
            or Library is code that you source from an external creator. This
            code is used in your personal projects but requires the dependency
            or library in order to be executable and for your project to
            function. After looking at possible types of libraries, I found I
            was drawn to ones that delt with CSS because I've engaged with that
            so much throughout this project - particularly with grids. I began
            to search for JavaScript libraries that specifically deal with grid
            layouts and came across a helpful yet not so helpful article - 10
            Best Javascript Grid Layout Libraries. It was helpful because it
            exposed me to the different ways libraries can be accessed. A
            dependency like
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://github.com/rebassjs/grid"
              >Rebass</a
            >
            can be found and downloaded through GitHub, source code for
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://codepen.io/aholachek/pen/VXjOPB"
              >animating grids</a
            >
            can be found in places like
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen.io.</a>
            Though what I found difficult with these options was that it was
            hard for me to understand how to use them. The readme file in Rebass
            seemed complicated and didn't feel in depth, I felt like I was
            supposed to instantly know fundamental concepts (something even like
            syntax) because the readme file didn't include thorough explanations
            on how to use the code and its functions. So, I was deterred from
            using those options. I heavily rely on YouTube tutorials and
            documentation, so when those resources are scant, I begin to feel
            ill-equipped to handle the code by myself.

          <h2 class="heading-two">Ideas and Goals</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            I obviously had to think about what I wanted to implement in the
            site in order to steer my dependency research. The goal was to
            achieve the brief's requirements of enhancing creativity and user
            experience. Because I have been dealing with grids throughout my
            entire site, I thought it could be 'nice' to animate some of them. I
            felt animations would introduce some creativity and affect the
            user's experience positively. My index and main blogs pages seemed
            like a good place for that because the grid items almost appear as
            separate cards organised on the page. I thought I could animate each
            blog 'card' to flip to an image of something that relates to the
            blog's content, and then flip back, when the user hovers over the
            card. So, I aggressively searched for 'flipping grid tutorials' and
            after not much luck, I switched over to searching for general grid
            animation tutorials. This is when I came across
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://animate.style/#usage"
              >Animate.css.</a
            >
            On the site, it first looked like I would only be applying it to
            text rather than the grids. But it was easy enough to figure out how
            to apply it to certain grid containers - and I didn't even need a
            flipping grid tutorial.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Animate.css doesn't include the animations I was particularly
            looking for, but what it did have was thorough detail on how to
            understand the library, its functionality, and its possibilities. I
            decided to go with it because I could actually understand how I
            could use and implement it into my website. It comes across as the
            safer option, but to me it was more about actually being able to
            understand what I was doing so that I could properly talk about it.
            I chose to add a few animations to some of the grids so that when
            you hover over them, they display a bit of 'personality' (aka
            they're attention seeking). Having a grid container move when the
            user hovers over it was important to me because it contrasts the
            container's content against the others that are static. Thus, the
            user's attention and focus are drawn to that area and its content
            making it more impactful and meaningful in that moment. I could use
            their JavaScript capabilities to globally set all animation times
            and/or delays. The use of this to me was that my animations were
            then more consistent across the site. I felt better consistency
            meant better readability because the user wouldn't be subjected to
            rogue or overwhelming animations taking over user's attention span.

          <h2 class="heading-two">Happily Ever After</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The Animate.css library helped me to achieve my goal and meet the
            briefs requirements in a way that I understood fully and comfortably
            - which was something also important to me. I wanted to utilise
            something I understood well because I wanted to be able to add it to
            my web-dev skillset. I began with not really even understanding what
            an external dependency or library would entail and ended up with
            using one that added value not only to my site but to my personal
            skillset too.
