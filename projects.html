          <h3>Sims 4 Activism Mod</h3>
          <p>
            Currently working on an activist mod for the Sims 4 where players
            can make their Sims fight for causes they believe in. So far I have
            been working on the underlying trait that the sims needs to have in
            order to play out activist scenarios - talking about socio-political
            issues or causes, trying to change an obstructionist's view, acting
            better than them and so on. Here are a few screenshots of how it's
            looking in the game.

          <h3>Covet Fashion Mod</h3>
          <p>
            Before starting on the Sims mod, I tried out a mod for another game,
            Covet Fashion. I wanted to make a sell system where the player could
            sell items of clothing they did not want anymore. This one was a of
            a flop in terms of its actual value in the game, but I was really
            happy with how far my coding skills came in this project.

              alt="Covet Closet Script"
            />
          </figure>
          <figcaption>
            The closet script contained dresses for selling examples. The
            dresses could be tried on, sold, their value subtracted from the
            players overall closet value, and the players cash increased.

          </figure>
          <figcaption>
            This is the UI of the mod. It made up of screenshot taken from the
            game itself as I wanted to creative a cohesive mod, not something
            that you could not picture in the game.

            />
          </figure>
          <figcaption>
            The sell script was where I had the most fun. Creating the SellDress
            function required me to make sure my other scripts were set up well
            so that I could make a function that combatted redundancy -
            something that I REALLY need to work on.

          <h3>Heartsherf</h3>
          <p>
            Heartsherf was inpsired by Arrietty and was worked on by Jessica Hon
            and I last year. The player plays as Bo, a miniature human who is
            always accompanied by a friendly bee. Bo begins in the stores front
            and will first come across the granny NPC. Talking to the granny
            will give the player a chance to obtain an object from the granny
            that will help Bo when meeting the second NPC, Alex, in the
            courtyard. Being a good listener will help you with the granny and
            being sympathetic and generous will help you with Alex. Jess worked
            on the artwork side of the project while I worked on the coding and
            programming.
