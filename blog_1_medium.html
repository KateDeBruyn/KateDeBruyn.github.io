          <h1 class="heading-one">McLuhan Reflection: Mediums as Messages</h1>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The McLuhan reading teaches us to think about how mediums become
            messages, how they influence those messages (in the methods a medium
            will use to communicate a message), and possibly how those messages
            can even then become their own mediums. Mediums have social,
            political, economic, personal consequences - affecting our ideas of
            humanity. This reading made me think of Stuart Hall's (1997) systems
            of representation - how signifier and signified make up a sign and
            how these signs sometimes create a universal language; a message.
            Within this, mediums are signs which contain messages exclusive to
            the content of the medium.

            An advert that appears on television holds a message in a different
            meaning than if that same message was conveyed in the medium of
            print. Adverts that appear on TV or radio indicate a connotative
            message that the company can afford an actress, a production team
            and the studio to shoot in. This may appear as a hidden message to
            the viewer or listener that the company is more reputable because of
            the 'luxury' they can afford to advertise their business. But
            compared to the possible expense of advertising on a billboard on
            William Nicol, it's hard to say if that connotative or hidden
            meaning holds much weight. In the case of the billboard medium,
            messages have to be aptly and skillfully designed to convey a strong
            message to those driving by - as the message needs to be received as
            quickly as possible. Does the medium then inflict the message with
            urgency? In this scenario, we see that the medium of the billboard
            influences the advert's message greatly in its creation and
            deliverance, purely from the message the medium conveys itself.

            There was a lot to unpack in the reading; these were two comments
            that I thought I'd add to the discussion: His point on the American
            Revolution, that it "had no medieval legal institutions to discard
            or to root out, apart from monarchy" (McLuhan, 1964, p.206), paired
            with his sentiment that England is yet to undergo their revolution,
            feels like it missed an opportunity to highlight the medieval
            legalities that the American Civil Rights movement aimed to root
            out. I know he's speaking on De Tocqueville's work and is focusing
            on technology but I feel this is important: The mediums of the
            movement, which I feel stretch all the way from posters to even
            schools (like in Little Rock), are such good examples of messages
            becoming mediums themselves. The protest at Little Rock Central
            Highschool can be encapsulated as a medium because it was a platform
            for white supremacists to spew their ideologies (their message), but
            the resulting message that came from their actions - black students
            being escorted by the military - became a medium for civil rights
            activists to further their message. I bring this up because McLuhan
            published this work in 1964, several years in to the CRM - a legal,
            political and social revolution in my opinion.

            "The grammar of print cannot help to construe the message of oral
            and nonwritten culture and institutions" (McLuhan, 1964, p.206) -
            this made me think of a reading on orality and oral cultures and how
            we learned about it in relation to storytelling. A spoken story (at
            first a message) told by a storyteller (arguably the medium) becomes
            itself a medium within the listener's memory (Ong, 2002). The story
            is now a medium in memory as its message is the contents that the
            listener remembers. The only change here is that the memory is the
            medium instead of the storyteller. Recalling elements of the story
            would then translate into a message that is relevant for the
            listeners current activity (like if they were talking to someone
            about a story they once heard or were applying a principle like
            forgiveness that they learned through the narrative). I feel the
            same process would happen with a written and read story, just that
            the messages would have different results. In this case, the reader
            is isolated and reads the message to themselves. Messages can
            sometimes be stronger when they come from someone else, like an oral
            storyteller. When we internalise messages by ourselves, we can only
            use our perspectives to understand that message. And this changes
            the meaning of a message greatly. Whereas sometimes, it's helpful to
            understand a message through the perspective of someone else,
            someone external. This long train of thought is to dance on the
            roles of the medium which, in this case, are minds. Our minds are
            mediums because of the way in which they house a message and what
            that message will then mean to us when it is recalled in the future.
            I could go on and on, but hopefully you sort of get the picture.

            Much like stories and storytellers, what this reading ultimately
            made me think of is games and game-makers. What messages will my
            games hold if they are influenced by the medium they are played
            through? The medium, as "any extension of ourselves" (McLuhan, 1964,
            p.203), shows the impact of scenarios like using mouse and keyboard
            as opposed to a controller. Technically and figuratively, the mouse,
            keyboard, and controller are extensions of ourselves and enable our
            bodies to create input. They are gateways to the medium (the game)
            but they also effect the reception of the message. Why does driving
            vehicles feel better on controller for some people? It is because
            the joysticks mimic a similar notion to steering? GTA and Rocket
            League, to me, are 100% better experienced through using a
            controller because steering the vehicles feels more natural than on
            mouse and keyboard. Thus, in a more personal opinion, Rocket League
            as a medium better expresses its message - soccer but with cars -
            through the help and enhancement of a controller. This avenue took a
            turn towards how we access a message from a medium, but hopefully
            also shed more light on the powerful influence mediums have on our
            choices - how our messages are influenced by the medium we choose
            because of the affordances given by that medium.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            Trying to conclude all of these different avenues may hopefully be
            done if I've made at least one point clear: mediums contain
            messages, but mediums themselves are also messages. And there is
            much that affects how these messages that mediums convey are created
            and understood. With that in mind, it will always be important to be
            critical of the medium you chose to convey a message, as some
            mediums will do better than others.
