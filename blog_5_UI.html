        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          When starting this UI and UX analysis and reflection, I realised that
          I have always understood these terms with a Graphic Design lens.
          Probably from having studied it for a year and encountering those
          terms for really the first time there. Back then though, I wasn't
          developing websites. The readings, lectures, and other course content
          we've been engaging with this year have directed my understanding of
          UI and UX towards the study of digital information. Thus, this
          analysis reflects on previous critical writings I've submitted as well
          as comparisons of my work against the course content we've engaged
          with.
        </p>
        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          In my
          <a class="hyperlink" href="blog_three.html">Design Metaphors</a>
          critical writing, I reflected on how these metaphors allow users to
          consume the information in front of them through key elements that
          Aaron Marcus (1998) defines as the concepts, terms and images that
          represent data, functions, tasks, organizations, and people. An
          example of this is the 'continue reading…' element I included in the
          main blog page, assigned to each available blog. It could be argued
          that, at least in English web development, that 'continue…' or
          'continue reading…' is a universal concept used to allow users to,
          quite literally, continue reading an article or blog that sparks their
          interest. It is a universal concept that represents a function that
          enabled users to choose how and what they want to interact with on my
          website. The main blog page lacked imagery in my first submission,
          something that I've now changed because it is another key element that
          also represents the data of the listed blogs. And while some people
          respond better to the written word, others respond better to imagery
          and visuals. So going back to this critical writing was important for
          me to realise those nuances and change my design choices - my UI and
          UX design choices.

        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          When comparing my website to the keys points that Peta Goldberg (2022)
          presented in her lecture, I noticed that I had but also lacked depth
          in my initial deployment. While UX makes interfaces useful, my
          navigation bar's shortfall was in that it was not anchored during a
          scroll down the page; meaning the user had to scroll all the way back
          to the top to use the nav bar. That doesn't make it seem very useful
          or user friendly. I included a 'get-in-contact' function to get my UX
          to accomplish goals too and introduce a call to action. Before that,
          it felt like the UX, like in the case of my first wireframe, was
          accomplishing the goal of showing my UI design choices. At least
          that's how I saw it initially anyway.
        </p>
        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          When thinking about how Peta's lecture and Marcus' reading connect, my
          use of the CSS grids came up. I used grids on. every. page. On Peta's
          side, it speaks to how UI deals with beauty and aesthetics and how
          using grids introduces a symmetrical balance to the page. These
          aspects tie in with Marcus' (1998) point on how metaphors achieve
          effectiveness through association of organisation or operation. A grid
          is organisational in terms of its structure - it can be perceived as a
          container and thus is appropriate for a user to find or assume to find
          information within it. Organisation and symmetry work together to make
          the information more easily consumable. Or at least that's just what I
          think by looking at my website at this point. However, what I make up
          for in organisation and readability, I feel I lack in creativity.

          In an article I came across by
          <a
            class="hyperlink"
            href="https://99designs.com/blog/web-digital/web-design-development-ui-ux-difference/#:~:text=User%20Interface%20(UI)%20%E2%80%94%20A,using%20the%20site%20or%20app."

          (2018), I found it interesting how he illustrated that the fields of
          web design, web development, UI, and UX are all interdependent. I felt
          I knew this, but he states it quite well in that, “it's less about
          which fields handle which tasks, and more about how each field
          considers the same task from a different point-of-view.” He relates
          this point to loading times; web design may show that the content is
          too much or too complicated, web development encourages one to see
          what files can be compressed, UI encourages the controls to be
          simplified so that the user's learnability and subsequent input is
          instantaneous, and UX enables the developer to prioritise loading
          times for the index page. This made me think of my style guide section
          and a blog post where I included a video. I feel the blog post was
          fine, but the quality of my style guide section felt off. I realised I
          scanned the wireframe draft at 200dpi when screens run at a
          traditional 72dpi. Instead of scanning it with a lower dpi, I went
          into illustrator and tried to compress it by changing the dimensions
          and compressing it to 72dpi. While it did lower the file size, I
          sacrificed quality and therefore the UI to some regard. And I did this
          all so that it could fit into the grid - content in my web design
          choices that's possibly too complicated.
        </p>
        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          I mentioned earlier that I felt like my wireframe represented more of
          my UI thoughts than it did my UX, and when I came across a reading by
          <a class="hyperlink" href="https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/120948"
            >Mariia Orlova</a
          >
          (2016), my feelings were confirmed. Wireframes should be “stripped of
          any visual design or branding elements” and should “define the
          hierarchy [and communication] of items” based on what we deem the
          user's needs are (Orlova 2016: 24). I spoke about graphic design, and
          I've completely forgotten about basic design principles as well as
          completely missing those points in Peta's lecture notes. These just
          have to be applied to the digital information and content that I'm
          trying to portray in my website. So, I need to work on and better my
          wireframes with all of this in mind. A rework is needed, and I can see
          it in my lack of simply not knowing what is important to add or what
          do to next.
        </p>

          I also may want to change my UI. I thought about this idea of having a
          theme change every two months or so that is based off my current
          interest - right now it's Komi Can't Communicate (anime). I feel like
          this will personalise the website even more and will be a bit of an
          easter egg moment to those who engage with the site. It will also keep
          me working on the site. I am happy with what I started with and
          submitted in the first assignment, but I feel like I can refine it in
          a new direction. Something that I am definitely looking forward to.
