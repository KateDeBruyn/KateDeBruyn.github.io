          <h1 class="heading-one">Reflection: UI and UX Design</h1>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            When starting this UI and UX analysis and reflection, I realised
            that I have always understood these terms with a Graphic Design
            lens. Probably from having studied it for a year and encountering
            those terms for really the first time there. Back then though, I
            wasn't developing websites. The readings, lectures, and other course
            content we've been engaging with this year have directed my
            understanding of UI and UX towards the study of digital information.
            Thus, this analysis reflects on previous critical writings I've
            submitted as well as comparisons of my work against the course
            content we've engaged with.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            In my
            <a class="hyperlink" href="blog_three.html">Design Metaphors</a>
            critical writing, I reflected on how these metaphors allow users to
            consume the information in front of them through key elements that
            Aaron Marcus (1998) defines as the concepts, terms and images that
            represent data, functions, tasks, organizations, and people. An
            example of this is the 'continue reading…' element I included in the
            main blog page, assigned to each available blog. It could be argued
            that, at least in English web development, that 'continue…' or
            'continue reading…' is a universal concept used to allow users to,
            quite literally, continue reading an article or blog that sparks
            their interest. It is a universal concept that represents a function
            that enabled users to choose how and what they want to interact with
            on my website.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            This also helpful in providing information on what the user can
            expect from a blogs page. I did feel that using some imagery would
            also help the user better identify what each blog entails. I found
            using images also helps the user understand the digital information
            in front of them by visualising a topic in this scenario. I had to
            edit the UX of the page in order to map the changes I wanted to make
            to the UI - adding images to each blog.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The main blog page lacked imagery in my first submission, something
            that I've now changed because it is another key element that also
            represents the data of the listed blogs. And while some people
            respond better to the written word, others respond better to imagery
            and visuals. So going back to this critical writing was important
            for me to realise those nuances and change my design choices - my UI
            and UX design choices.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            When comparing my website to the keys points that Peta Goldberg
            (2022) presented in her lecture, I noticed that I had but also
            lacked depth in my initial deployment. While UX makes interfaces
            useful, my navigation bar's shortfall was in that it was not
            anchored during a scroll down the page; meaning the user had to
            scroll all the way back to the top to use the nav bar. That doesn't
            make it seem very useful or user friendly.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            Anchoring the nav bar was also important in making the user feel
            grounded as opposed to lost. Navigation is an important aspect of UI
            and UX design, and having anchoring elements supports that notion as
            the user is given the ability to always 'find' themselves on the
            page. I needed to introduce this to my blog and projects pages too.
            I have reflected on those changes
            <a class="hyperlink" href="blog_reflection.html">here.</a> From
            tweaking and refining the anchoring and spatial awareness notions of
            my website, I thought about what connection the user may be making
            with my website. Furthermore, what connection they may be making
            with me. I thought of this quite literally at first, so I began with
            finding a way the user could get in touch with me.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            I included a 'get-in-contact'wireframe to rework my UX to accomplish
            these 'connectivity' goals I had and to also introduce a call to
            action functionality. Before that, it felt like the UX of my
            website, like in my first wireframe, was accomplishing the goal of
            showing my UI design choices. I felt like my wireframe represented
            more of my UI thoughts than it did my UX, and when I came across a
            reading by
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/120948"
              >Mariia Orlova</a
            >
            (2016), my feelings were confirmed. Wireframes should be “stripped
            of any visual design or branding elements” and should “define the
            hierarchy [and communication] of items” based on what we deem the
            user's needs are (Orlova 2016: 24). I spoke about graphic design,
            and I've completely forgotten about basic design principles as well
            as completely missing those points in Peta's lecture notes. These
            just have to be applied to the digital information and content that
            I'm trying to portray in my website. So, I need to work on and
            better my wireframes with all of this in mind. A rework is needed,
            and I can see it in my lack of simply not knowing what is important
            to add or what do to next.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            I was putting a lot of focus on my UI which included hyperfocusing
            on grids. My website's UI is largely and almost solely influenced by
            grids, and thus, its UX is built and formed around grid structures.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            When thinking about how Peta's lecture and Marcus' reading connect,
            my use of the CSS grids came up. I used grids on. every. page. On
            Peta's side, it speaks to how UI deals with beauty and aesthetics
            and how using grids introduces a symmetrical balance to the page.
            These aspects tie in with Marcus' (1998) point on how metaphors
            achieve effectiveness through association of organisation or
            operation. A grid is organisational in terms of its structure - it
            can be perceived as a container and thus is appropriate for a user
            to find or assume to find information within it. Organisation and
            symmetry work together to make the information more easily
            consumable. Or at least that's just what I think by looking at my
            website at this point. However, what I make up for in organisation
            and readability, I feel I lack in creativity.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            I also may want to change my UI. I thought about this idea of having
            a theme change every two months or so that is based off my current
            interest - right now it's Komi Can't Communicate (anime). I feel
            like this will personalise the website even more and will be a bit
            of an easter egg moment to those who engage with the site. It will
            also keep me working on the site. I am happy with what I started
            with and submitted in the first assignment, but I feel like I can
            refine it in a new direction. Something that I am definitely looking
            forward to.

            In an article I came across by
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://99designs.com/blog/web-digital/web-design-development-ui-ux-difference/#:~:text=User%20Interface%20(UI)%20%E2%80%94%20A,using%20the%20site%20or%20app."
              >Matt Ellis</a
            >
            (2018), I found it interesting how he illustrated that the fields of
            web design, web development, UI, and UX are all interdependent. I
            felt I knew this, but he states it quite well in that, “it's less
            about which fields handle which tasks, and more about how each field
            considers the same task from a different point-of-view.” He relates
            this point to loading times; web design may show that the content is
            too much or too complicated, web development encourages one to see
            what files can be compressed, UI encourages the controls to be
            simplified so that the user's learnability and subsequent input is
            instantaneous, and UX enables the developer to prioritise loading
            times for the index page. This made me think of my style guide
            section and a blog post where I included a video. I feel the blog
            post was fine, but the quality of my style guide section felt off. I
            realised I scanned the wireframe draft at 200dpi when screens run at
            a traditional 72dpi. Instead of scanning it with a lower dpi, I went
            into illustrator and tried to compress it by changing the dimensions
            and compressing it to 72dpi. While it did lower the file size, I
            sacrificed quality and therefore the UI to some regard. And I did
            this all so that it could fit into the grid - content in my web
            design choices that's possibly too complicated.
