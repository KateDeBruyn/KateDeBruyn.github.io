        <h2 id="blog-heading">Internet, Society and Design Justice</h2>
        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          When first thinking about the internet, society, and design justice
          topic, I immediately thought about the critical writing I did on
          <a class="hyperlink" href=""></a> information geographies. Their
          research clearly showed areas where design and digital injustice is
          prevalent - entire regions where, though they may have access to the
          internet, the data itself is almost unaffordable. Regions, like India,
          where there are many internet users, but few registered domains
          (Graham et al 2015: 94). The empirical and quantitative data collected
          for this research showed uneven geographies in internet access and
          enablement, subsequent digital participation, and digital
          representation. There was a throughline that intrinsically linked the
          three sections in that one almost always lead to the other. A person
          who has a disadvantageous internet access (either it is too expensive
          or perhaps not readily accessible in their home) is less likely to
          participate online and thus, sees the space for their digital
          representation shrink. Their article offered research that could be
          looked at through a lens of digital equality. In the practice of
          digital equality, we are engaging with “the analog and digital aspects
          of political, social, cultural and economic dimensions in society” <a
          class="hyperlink"
          href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/digital-equality-interview-nanjira-sambuli/"
          >(Sambuli in Magnoni 2019).</a>
          The aim of this practice is to close the gap between
          the unequal and the privileged through technology - and this could be
          done so through understanding and investigating design justice.

            >Justice by Design, Antionette Carroll</a
          >
          explains areas of design injustice. Injustice can be found in design
          that is systemic, such as the design choices of media coverage. It is
          seen in what headliner they may choose, or font they may use, the
          image they decide on, the edit of the video; like in some of the media
          coverage we saw around the Black Lives Matter protests. Digital
          articles and videos circulated different arguments and skewed
          perspectives, but in each of them were systemic design choices that
          show that “systems of oppression, injustices, and inequities are
          designed” (Carroll 2017). Costanza-Chock (in Geyser 2021) leans into the “design
          of sociotechnical systems”, systems whose design technologically and
          socially intersect and thus brings together the injustices of each.
          And design justice is intrinsically intersectional - from who or what
          the designed information is about to who or what has access to that
          information. In order to flesh out the point I'm trying to make, I
          will use a current project I am working on as an example.

          Flanagan and Nissenbaum (2007) offer a methodology game designers may
          use when designing games with strong social themes and implications.
          Their article situates design justice (and injustice) from the
          position of the designer. They call upon the designer to hold
          themselves and their projects accountable, against a methodology that
          helps root out design injustice. They call it the Values at Play (VAP)
          approach. It encourages designers and design teams to discover and
          define the values their game will have, translate these values into
          the structure, the architecture, of the game and verify that the
          values were received in the way they should have been.
          <a class="hyperlink" href="projects.html">The Sims 4 Activism Mod</a>
          that I am working on will deeply benefit from this methodology. In
          short, I am creating a mod that allows players to make their Sims
          activists so that they can fight for social and socio-political
          causes. As Flanagan and Nissenbaum (2007: 183) state, “sometimes,
          values are expressed explicitly in the functional definition of a
          system”. The values of the activism mod may be clear to some: values
          of equality, justice, inclusion. The issue that lies here though is
          that these are my values. I haven't compared these to or against other
          people's values and views on activism. Some may feel including
          cooperation and security is a must. This could be found out through
          playtesting (verification). Another point made by Flanagan and
          Nissenbaum (2007: 184), is that a “game's reward system is a crucial
          mechanism for expressing the game's goals and values”. My mod has an
          aspect where Sims who complete the activism aspiration track receive
          what is know as a reward trait - a personality trait that can only be
          gained through completing aspirations. So, the question for me is,
          what would be a meaningful and rewarding trait to obtain? How will
          this trait embody the mod's goals and values?
        </p>
        <p id="blog-paragraph">
          Carroll (2017) challenges that the definitions for design and designer
          should be reworked. They should be based on the question: does the
          solution I am designing create a better world or at least a better
          outcome? And from here we can also draw from the principles of design
          justice (Geyser 2021): the designer must be a facilitator and offer solutions
          that sustain, heal, and empower rather than exploit. In terms of me
          being the designer for the mod, I must ask myself the questions (and
          answer them): does this mod facilitate activist values? Or does
          indulge me of a white saviour complex? Will players find the mod
          healing and empowering or will their real-life experiences feel
          exploited by me? And to bring it back to the initial connections made
          in the writing, who will have access to this mod? It is already
          exclusive to The Sims players. Who has access to the game? Since it
          isn't a free game, it's essentially a luxury. And furthermore, who
          will be able to participate and thus be represented? My mod may not
          bridge the gaps found in digital inequality, but at least it does
          offer me a place to investigate my place and position as a designer,
          something I feel we should all be doing.
