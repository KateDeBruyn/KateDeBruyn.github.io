          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            When first thinking about the internet, society, and design justice
            topic, I immediately thought about the critical writing I did on
            <a class="hyperlink" href="blog_4_geographies.html"
              >information geographies.</a
            >Their research clearly showed areas where design and digital
            injustice is prevalent - entire regions where, though they may have
            access to the internet, the data itself is almost unaffordable.
            Regions, like India, where there are many internet users, but few
            registered domains (Graham et al 2015: 94). The empirical and
            quantitative data collected for this research showed uneven
            geographies in internet access and enablement, subsequent digital
            participation, and digital representation. There was a throughline
            that intrinsically linked the three sections in that one almost
            always lead to the other. A person who has a disadvantageous
            internet access (either it is too expensive or perhaps not readily
            accessible in their home) is less likely to participate online and
            thus, sees the space for their digital representation shrink. Their
            article offered research that could be looked at through a lens of
            digital equality.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            Internet inequality is also shown through their research as it lies
            at the forefront of their investigation - who is connected, how, to
            what extent and impact? United Nations and Amnesty International
            recognise internet as a basic human right and even the Indian
            Supreme Court declared it fundamental (Kasapis 2020). Kasapis wrote
            their article 5 years after Graham et al. and it would be
            interesting to see India's statistics now in 2022. In 2015, India
            showed its populous as one of the largest internet users even with
            less than 20% of them online, they had the cheapest broadband
            expenses but few registered domain names (which indicates their
            participation in terms of creating digital information), few GitHub
            commits and scant georeferenced objects in freebase (Graham et al.
            2015). Would declaring internet connection as a constitutional right
            improve their online representation and creation of digital content?
            One platform Graham et al. could have investigated was YouTube as it
            provides tons of information on who is posting what and from where.
            Numerous tutorials, with high viewing rates, have been made by
            Indian content creators over the last few years and there may be
            even more in the last two years. This should not be discredited as a
            form of online representation. Where India's internet inequality
            lies though, is in their minority of internet users. And it is hard
            to understand why this is the case when they have some the cheapest
            broadband prices. Is it possible because the surrounding
            infrastructure is too expensive? Average electricity costs have
            doubled over the last year, according to a report analysing the
            Indian Energy Exchange Ltd
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/average-power-price-on-indian-energy-exchange-hits-13-year-high-in-march/articleshow/90692923.cms"
              >(Reuters 2022)</a
            >. Thus, it is possibly too expensive to maintain access to the
            internet for having a computer or laptop may increase household
            electricity costs. The design of India's electricity, connectivity,
            and overall digital, infrastructure shows potential injustice and
            situates itself in the economic dimensions within India's society.

            In the practice of digital equality, we are engaging with “the
            analog and digital aspects of political, social, cultural and
            economic dimensions in society”

            and the privileged through technology - and this could be one so
            through understanding and investigating design justice.

            >
            explains areas of design injustice. Injustice can be found in design
            that is systemic, such as the design choices of media coverage. It
            is seen in what headliner they may choose, or font they may use, the
            image they decide on, the edit of the video; like in some of the
            media coverage we saw around the Black Lives Matter protests.
            Digital articles and videos circulated different arguments and
            skewed perspectives, but in each of them were systemic design
            choices that show that “systems of oppression, injustices, and
            inequities are designed” (Carroll 2017). Costanza-Chock (in Geyser
            2021) leans into the “design of sociotechnical systems”, systems
            whose design technologically and socially intersect and thus brings
            together the injustices of each. And design justice is intrinsically
            intersectional - from who or what the designed information is about
            to who or what has access to that information. In order to flesh out
            the point I'm trying to make, I will use a current project I am
            working on as an example.

            Flanagan and Nissenbaum (2007) offer a methodology game designers
            may use when designing games with strong social themes and
            implications. Their article situates design justice (and injustice)
            from the position of the designer. They call upon the designer to
            hold themselves and their projects accountable, against a
            methodology that helps root out design injustice. They call it the
            Values at Play (VAP) approach. It encourages designers and design
            teams to discover and define the values their game will have,
            translate these values into the structure, the architecture, of the
            game and verify that the values were received in the way they should
            have been.
            <a class="hyperlink" href="projects.html"
              >The Sims 4 Activism Mod</a
            >
            that I am working on will deeply benefit from this methodology. In
            short, I am creating a mod that allows players to make their Sims
            activists so that they can fight for social and socio-political
            causes. As Flanagan and Nissenbaum (2007: 183) state, “sometimes,
            values are expressed explicitly in the functional definition of a
            system”. The values of the activism mod may be clear to some: values
            of equality, justice, inclusion. The issue that lies here though is
            that these are my values. I haven't compared these to or against
            other people's values and views on activism. Some may feel including
            cooperation and security is a must. This could be found out through
            playtesting (verification). Another point made by Flanagan and
            Nissenbaum (2007: 184), is that a “game's reward system is a crucial
            mechanism for expressing the game's goals and values”. My mod has an
            aspect where Sims who complete the activism aspiration track receive
            what is know as a reward trait - a personality trait that can only
            be gained through completing aspirations. So, the question for me
            is, what would be a meaningful and rewarding trait to obtain? How
            will this trait embody the mod's goals and values?
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            These questions come out of thinking critically about design choices
            and how these choices encourage design justice. It is important that
            a designer practices and includes design justice in what they
            create.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Carroll (2017) challenges that the definitions for design and
            designer should be reworked. They should be based on the question:
            does the solution I am designing create a better world or at least a
            better outcome? And from here we can also draw from the principles
            of design justice (Geyser 2021): the designer must be a facilitator
            and offer solutions that sustain, heal, and empower rather than
            exploit. In terms of me being the designer for the mod, I must ask
            myself the questions (and answer them): does this mod facilitate
            activist values? Or does indulge me of a white saviour complex? Will
            players find the mod healing and empowering or will their real-life
            experiences feel exploited by me? And to bring it back to the
            initial connections made in the writing, who will have access to
            this mod? It is already exclusive to The Sims players. Who has
            access to the game? Since it isn't a free game, it's essentially a
            luxury. And furthermore, who will be able to participate and thus be
            represented? My mod may not bridge the gaps found in digital
            inequality, but at least it does offer me a place to investigate my
            place and position as a designer, something I feel we should all be
            doing.
