            This critical reflection will dissect and discuss Towards a study of
            information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of
            the geographies of information by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata,
            and Matthew A. Zook.

          <h3 class="heading-three">Aims:</h3>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Their paper investigated how information geographies have and are
            influenced by their own geographies of access, participation, and
            representation. They called these components geographic
            distributors.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-three">Methodology:</h3>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Graham et al used multiple bespoke data and statistics, mostly
            quantitative and empirical data, to construe a broad survey that
            showcases a range of uneven geographies in access, participation,
            and representation. They used this method to analyse and report on
            three sections of their paper: geographies of access and enablement,
            geographies of participation and geographies of representation.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-three">Observations and Results:</h3>
          <h4 class="heading-four">Geographies of access and enablement</h4>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            This section investigated who and from where has access to the
            “technologies and services essential for digital communication,
            participation, and representation” (Graham et al 2015). They
            compiled data on internet users by country and compared that to the
            cost of broadband versus the average income. The data collected for
            internet users by country shows the global north has the most
            “internet penetration” than the global south, yet the cost of
            broadband data is most expensive in mainly Africa. They conclude
            this section with noting that the inability to connect to internet
            likely means participation and contribution becomes impossible.
            Access and enablement are heavily determined by affordability. But
            with affordability comes the not so hidden costs that Graham et. al
            could have included in their observation; internet access requires
            electricity which also must be paid for. It requires a device to be
            accessed on (which will also affect the effectiveness of
            participation) which has either been bought or is on some sort of
            contract. These are possibly some of the “contextual causes of these
            uneven geographies” (102) that need to be consider when furthering
            this investigation.
          </p>
          <h4 class="heading-four">Geographies of participation</h4>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            This section explores where digital information is created and
            produced. They sourced data from domain names, GitHub users and
            repositories, and Wikipedia to access “location[s] of digital
            content” (Graham et al 93 2015). Most domains are registered in
            Europe and North America which contrasts against most internet users
            in the global north. Thus, “large internet populations do not
            automatically translate into large numbers of domain registrations”
            (Graham et al 2015:95). GitHub statistics were able to show areas
            that are collaboratively developing code. Wikipedia contributions
            showed where content is being created from and furthermore how much
            is localised. The results of their data show that “geographies of
            participation matter are tied to how content and locales or places
            is created in different parts of the world” (97).
          </p>
          <h4 class="heading-four">Geographies of representation</h4>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Graham et al use Google Search, OpenStreetMap and the Semantic Web
            to show the digital geographies of representation. There are
            regions, like the US, that have the most mentions in Google's index.
            They felt that a lot of representation happens when organisations
            invest or show interest in another place - like the EU creating a
            geographical information structure in Nepal. Something like this
            also happens because of the media and social media's geocoding. The
            paper up until this point portrays that the (im)mutable
            augmentations (unchanging and changing expansions) that are within
            information geographies are heavily influenced by the chain of who
            has access and is enabled, therefore who is participating and thus
            who is represented. And according to the results, the global
            north-west and much of northern Europe lead in all three categories.
            Thus, the global mid-south experiences the least of any of these
            categories as well as partially the global north-east.
          </p>
          <h3 class="heading-three">Critique, Reflection and Conclusions</h3>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The paper, as the authors have acknowledged, lacks in thorough
            global evidence. Not only is it written in English, but it was
            researched in English. One of the biggest discrepancies because of
            this is seen in the Wikipedia research - “we were only able to use
            data about the English version of Wikipedia because the method of
            geolocating user profiles involved parsing unstructured
            English-language text” (Graham et. al 2015:97). Had they included
            bi-lingual researchers (or even translators) who could investigate
            the non-English web territory, they may have found different results
            for the middle-east and north-east regions.
          </p>
          <p class="blog-paragraph-new">
            What is most striking about this paper is their note on the work
            that needs to be done to begin to understand “the contextual causes
            of these uneven geographies” (Graham et. al 2015:102). Geographies
            of representation is a great place to explore race, religion, gender
            and identity, communities like LGBTQIA+ and intersectionality. What
            platforms do access and enablement afford participation? What are
            the rules and regulations of these platforms that protect those
            participation as lack of would perhaps lead to even less
            participation? One example of this is a Twitch streamer who was
            banned for hate speech and moved over to another streaming platform
            called DLive to continue his agenda of spreading the word of God
            (where the hate speech was underlined by telling other players,
            mostly children and in one particular case a Muslim child, that they
            were going to hell). DLive came under critique in 2020 when they
            changed their Twitter bio to “All Lives Matter” and other agenda's
            lead them to be accused of supporting and encouraging white
            supremacist and nationalist ideals (Bergengruen 2020 and Kurtis
            Connor 2021). Thus, in this case, certain participation shows how it
            can undermine and aim to silence participation of underrepresented
            and often discriminated communities. It is a doubled edged sword.

            There is also evidence of internet infrastructure that is deeply
            saturated with colonialism. The following figure is taken from James
            Bridle's interview (Verso Books 2018) about his book A New Dark Age.

            This image depicts Mediterranean Undersea Cables that supply
            internet. Cables that flow from England end in parts of India, a
            former British colony in terms of “physical” colonisation. Spain to
            this day holds a “protectorate” over Morocco and equips them with
            internet cables. In this scenario, if Morocco had to revolt and
            fight for full independence, would their internet supply be severed?
            Is this a modern-day form of control?

            These are two avenues that could be explored in the contextualising
            work Graham et al. speak of. Their research and observations are
            good throughways to interrogating the contextual settings of why
            these geographies of information are the way they are under a
            localised lens. These are important aspects of the world wide web to
            consider as they will influence the way in which we as digital
            designers use the internet to research and produce information.
