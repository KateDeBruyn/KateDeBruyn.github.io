          <h2 class="heading-two">Semantic Markup: What is it?</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Coding languages, like HTML in our case, make use of semantic markup
            as it involves the structuring of the code we write in order to
            focus on the code's content above all other qualities. The word
            semantic refers to meaning in language or logic and markup, in
            coding, refers to labels assigned to sections of text to indicate
            and declare their position in the text as a whole. Thus, semantic
            markup involves applying the methods of "markup" to the "semantics",
            the language used, in code. I understand semantic markup as grammar
            for code.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-two">Why is it necessary?</h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            Understanding semantic markup as grammar sets one up to understand
            its importance. Good grammar, as in good semantic markup, means that
            the meaning of text and the language used to produce that text
            (HTML) is less likely to be misunderstood by any other person or
            program, or even yourself, when engaging with that text. It also
            means that other processes, such as ones search engines use or the
            process a writer will undergo when using CSS, are much easier to
            perform and execute. Search engines like Google require good
            semantic markup in order to position the web page, in the ocean we
            call internet, correctly. This is a achieved through markup's
            ability to optimise the importance of certain elements of text -
            such as a heading versus a paragraph. This also means that the code
            is accessible to applications and can be used in the correct way - a
            good example of this is Google Calendar's ability to use the
            information from emails or other sites to create detailed events in
            your calendar. Using the correct tags in the HMTL document means
            that styling with CSS is a much more ordered and easier process.
            Code with good semantic markup also means that any changes made to
            the the text can be done so without destabilising the flow and
            structure of the document.
