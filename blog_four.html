          The webiste thus far is made up of very simple HTML and CSS but is
          backed by the content we've enaged with this year. A reading that
          struck out the most to me was McLuhan's "The Medium Is The Message".
          It made me think about how my webiste, regardless of its text and
          imagery, represents me. I feel that the colour scheme I've gone with
          sort of speaks to a computer-esque aesthetic which is important for me
          to portray because of the field of study and industry I'm in. That
          being "digital". I thought about the anatomy of the website and what I
          want it to represent. After coming across CSS grid
          <a
            class="continue"
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo&t=377s"

          I realised that this would be a great way to maintain consistency
          throughout my website. Consistency in design has the power to
          familiarise the viewer with a certain brand or aesthetic and to link
          that to their idea of the developer... me. That's important when
          building a portfolio. You want your audience to be able to recognise
          that even the website itself is the portfolio. The medium is the
          message. Does my website and its content scream keightyrose? Is the
          message "third year student"? But the choice to use a somewhat
          consistent design scheme is honestly more selfish. Design often
          reflects the designers personal ongoings; what is inspiring them,
          influencing them, holding them back, spiralling them into despair,
          showing that despair… And that's maybe why I choice consistency
          because it is one of my biggest struggles. It's hard to know if it's
          mental health related or just straight up laziness, and it's even
          harder to admit and overcome both. So at first glance it may have this
          minimalistic appeal (something I'm not against but if you had to see
          my house…), some may even think it's boring, but it's what represents
          me right now. I wanted neatly contained bite-sized pieces of
          information that are easy to take in.I also thought a lot about how
          much time a person may want to spend reading or looking at something,
          so I didn't want these huge long sections of information that a viewer
          would get bored with. This is also why the UI and UX research was
          really helpful. In my website's "design metaphor", I'm using
          association: a blue, black and white colour scheme, coupled with
          imagery of VR and motherboards, that is often associated with gaming
          and computers and the life of a 26 year old Sims addict. And thank
          goddess for the Semantic Markup research because I have a long way to
          go with that. But the introduction put me on the right track. Not only
          is important for my website to be organised and easily consumable, but
          the same goes for the code behind it. The website still has a long way
          to go, there's a lot of refining that it needs and there are areas
          that I can see I can do better in (like how many rectangular grids can
          she actually have??).
