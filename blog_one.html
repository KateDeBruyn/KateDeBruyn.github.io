        <h2 class="headings-two">McLuhan Reflection: Mediums as Messages</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          I feel that the McLuhan reading teaches us to think about how mediums
          become messages, how they influence those messages (in the methods a
          medium will use to communication a message), and possibly how those
          messages can even then become their own mediums. Mediums have social,
          political, economic, personal consequences - affecting our ideas of
          humanity. This reading made me think of Stuart Hall's systems of
          representation - how signifier and signified make up a sign and how
          these signs sometimes create a universal language, a message. Within
          this, mediums are signs which contain messages exclusive to the
          content of the medium. Adverts that appear on TV or radio indicate a
          message that the company can afford such an expense, possibly making
          them seem more reputable, as opposed to seeing a written advert in the
          classified section of a newspaper. There was a lot to unpack in the
          reading, hopefully we can briefly talk about it in next week's round
          table. But otherwise these were too comments that I thought I'd add to
          the discussion: His point on the American Revolution, that it "had no
          medieval legal institutions to discard or to root out, apart from
          monarchy", paired with his sentiment that England is yet to undergo
          their revolution, feels like it missed an opportunity to highlight the
          medieval legalities that the American Civil Rights movement aimed to
          root out. I know he's speaking on De Tocqueville's work and is
          focusing on technology but I feel this is important: The mediums of
          the movement, which I feel stretch all the way from posters to even
          schools (like in Little Rock), are such good examples of messages
          becoming mediums themselves. The protest at Little Rock Central
          Highschool can be encapsulated as a medium because it was a platform
          for white supremacists to spew their ideologies (their message), but
          the resulting message that came from their actions - black students
          being escorted by the military - became a medium for civil rights
          activists to further their message. I bring this up because McLuhan
          published this work in 1964, several years in to the CRM - a legal,
          political and social revolution in my opinion.

        <p class="paragraph">
          The grammar of print cannot help to construe the message of oral and
          nonwritten culture and institutions" (page 4) - this made me think of
          a reading on orality and oral cultures and how we learned about it in
          relation to storytelling - a spoken story (at first a message) told by
          a storyteller (arguably the medium) becomes itself a medium within the
          listener's memory. Remembering and recalling the relevance of the
          story (or the even storyteller) would then translate into a message
          that is relevant for the listeners current activity (like if they were
          talking to someone about a story they once heard). I feel the same
          process would happen with a written and read story, just that the
          messages would have different results. What this reading ultimately
          made me think of is what messages my future games will hold depending
          on the medium they are played through. That the medium, as "any
          extension of ourselves", shows the impact of scenarios like using
          mouse and keyboard as opposed to a controller. GTA and Rocket League,
          to me, are 100% better experienced through using a controller. Maybe
          that comes from my personal background (it probably does), but it's
          the same as preferring Sims on PC rather than PS2 or mobile. With
          regards to Sims, PC and mobile versions are almost totally different
          games. And they have these vast differences because they are being
          played on different mediums which limit and allow for different types
          of gameplay - that would be a cool essay to dive into.
