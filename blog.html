          <h3>McLuhan Reflection: Mediums as Messages</h3>
          <p>
            The McLuhan reading teaches us to think about how mediums become
            messages, how they influence those messages (in the methods a medium
            will use to communication a message), and possibly how those
            messages can even then become their own mediums. Mediums have
            social, political, economic, personal consequences - affecting our
            ideas of humanity...<a class="continue" href="blog_one.html"

          <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
          <p>
            Coding languages, like HTML in our case, make use of semantic markup
            as it involves the structuring of the code we write in order to
            focus on the code's content above all other qualities. The word
            semantic refers to meaning in language or logic and markup, in
            coding, refers to labels assigned to sections of text to indicate
            and declare their position in the text as a whole...<a

          <p>
            In any instance of processing digital information, User Interface
            and User Experience form an integral part. Within their design lie
            metaphors - key elements, like concepts, terms and images, that
            represent data in order for a user to comprehend, consume, recall
            and command...<a class="continue" href="blog_three.html"

          <h3>Reflections</h3>
          <p>
            The webiste thus far is made up of very simple HTML and CSS but is
            backed by the content we've enaged with this year. A reading that
            struck out the most to me was McLuhan's "The Medium Is The Message".
            It made me think about how my webiste, regardless of its text and
            imagery, represents me...<a class="continue" href="blog_four.html"

          <h3>UI and UX Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            When starting this UI and UX analysis and reflection, I realised
            that I have always understood these terms with a Graphic Design
            lens. Probably from having studied it for a year and encountering
            those terms for really the first time there. Back then though, I
            wasn't developing websites...

            This essay will aim to define and situate the creative class as they
            have been deemed “model entrepreneurs” and then highlight the
            effects that the labour of the creative class undergoes within
            capitalism, digitilisation and the advancement of technology...<a

          <h3>Intermediality and The Sims 3</h3>
          <p>
            In the piece of intermedial narration I made, I based the project
            off a “practiced-based research” approach. This approach is where
            the artefact in its final form is the central constituent of the
            project. I chose to create a crossover between the story of The
            Adventures of Tintin, a comic begun by Hergé (Georges Remi) in 19291
            and the videogame, The Sims 3: World Adventures (2009)...<a
