          <h3>McLuhan Reflection: Mediums as Messages</h3>
          <p>
            The McLuhan reading teaches us to think about how mediums become
            messages, how they influence those messages (in the methods a medium
            will use to communication a message), and possibly how those
            messages can even then become their own mediums. Mediums have
            social, political, economic, personal consequences - affecting our
            ideas of humanity...<a class="continue" href="blog_one.html"

          <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
          <p>
            Coding languages, like HTML in our case, make use of semantic markup
            as it involves the structuring of the code we write in order to
            focus on the code's content above all other qualities. The word
            semantic refers to meaning in language or logic and markup, in
            coding, refers to labels assigned to sections of text to indicate
            and declare their position in the text as a whole...<a

            In any instance of processing digital information, User Interface
            and User Experience form an integral part. Within their design lie
            metaphors - key elements, like concepts, terms and images, that

            This essay will summarise and discuss arguments on the self-brand,
            its unpaid creation process, and its platform-specific adherences.
            Furthermore, it will discuss the consequences this practise, within
            the social media ecology, have on online content producers. Platform
            capitalism and labour will be defined and their roles within the
