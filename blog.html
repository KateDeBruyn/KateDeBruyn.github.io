            <h2>McLuhan Reflection: Mediums as Messages</h2>
            <p>
              The McLuhan reading teaches us to think about how mediums become
              messages, how they influence those messages (in the methods a
              medium will use to communication a message), and possibly how
              those messages can even then become their own mediums. Mediums
              have social, political, economic, personal consequences -
              affecting our ideas of humanity...<a

              Coding languages, like HTML in our case, make use of semantic
              markup as it involves the structuring of the code we write in
              order to focus on the code's content above all other qualities.
              The word semantic refers to meaning in language or logic and
              markup, in coding, refers to labels assigned to sections of text
              to indicate and declare their position in the text as a whole...<a

              When starting this UI and UX analysis and reflection, I realised
              that I have always understood these terms with a Graphic Design
              lens. Probably from having studied it for a year and encountering
              those terms for really the first time there. Back then though, I

              geographies research article by Mark Graham, Stefano De Sabbata,
              and Matthew A. Zook (2015). Their research clearly showed areas

              For this exam, we had the task of researching and using an
              external JavaScript Dependency or Library to improve the usability
              and/or functionality of the site. I had to begin with researching
              what all of that meant. From what I understand now, a JavaScript

              The webiste thus far is made up of very simple HTML and CSS but is
              backed by the content we've enaged with this year. A reading that
              struck out the most to me was McLuhan's "The Medium Is The

              In the piece of intermedial narration I made, I based the project
              off a “practiced-based research” approach. This approach is where
              the artefact in its final form is the central constituent of the
              project. I chose to create a crossover between the story of The
              Adventures of Tintin, a comic begun by Hergé (Georges Remi) in
              19291 and the videogame, The Sims 3: World Adventures (2009)...<a
