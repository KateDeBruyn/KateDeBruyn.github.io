            Website Iteration One
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            The webiste thus far is made up of very simple HTML and CSS but is
            backed by the content we've enaged with this year. A reading that
            struck out the most to me was McLuhan's "The Medium Is The Message".
            It made me think about how my webiste, regardless of its text and
            imagery, represents me. I feel that the colour scheme I've gone with
            sort of speaks to a computer-esque aesthetic which is important for
            me to portray because of the field of study and industry I'm in.
            That being "digital". I thought about the anatomy of the website and
            what I want it to represent. After coming across CSS grid
            <a
              class="hyperlink"
              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xMQfnTU6oo&t=377s"
              >tutorial</a
            >
            I realised that this would be a great way to maintain consistency
            throughout my website. Consistency in design has the power to
            familiarise the viewer with a certain brand or aesthetic and to link
            that to their idea of the developer... me. That's important when
            building a portfolio. You want your audience to be able to recognise
            that even the website itself is the portfolio. The medium is the
            message. Does my website and its content scream keightyrose? Is the
            message "third year student"? But the choice to use a somewhat
            consistent design scheme is honestly more selfish. Design often
            reflects the designers personal ongoings; what is inspiring them,
            influencing them, holding them back, spiralling them into despair,
            showing that despair… And that's maybe why I choice consistency
            because it is one of my biggest struggles. It's hard to know if it's
            mental health related or just straight up laziness, and it's even
            harder to admit and overcome both. So at first glance it may have
            this minimalistic appeal (something I'm not against but if you had
            to see my house…), some may even think it's boring, but it's what
            represents me right now. I wanted neatly contained bite-sized pieces
            of information that are easy to take in.I also thought a lot about
            how much time a person may want to spend reading or looking at
            something, so I didn't want these huge long sections of information
            that a viewer would get bored with. This is also why the UI and UX
            research was really helpful. In my website's "design metaphor", I'm
            using association: a blue, black and white colour scheme, coupled
            with imagery of VR and motherboards, that is often associated with
            gaming and computers and the life of a 26 year old Sims addict. And
            thank goddess for the Semantic Markup research because I have a long
            way to go with that. But the introduction put me on the right track.
            Not only is important for my website to be organised and easily
            consumable, but the same goes for the code behind it. The website
            still has a long way to go, there's a lot of refining that it needs
            and there are areas that I can see I can do better in (like how many
            rectangular grids can she actually have??).

            Website Iteration Two
          </h2>
          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            This iteration focused on the JavaScript we've learned so far. There
            is still more HTML and CSS refining that I would like to get to, but
            this got overtaken by the new content I needed to add to the site
            being the JavaScript implementation and critical writings. Watching
            Andre's tutorial on generating random quotes is what inspired the
            'random' video game idea (also inspired by
            <a class="hyperlink" href="https://videogamena.me/"
              >Video Game Name Generator</a
            >). It felt fitting to have something like this in my site given the
            field I'm in. Like with most coding languages however, I feel like
            my lack of knowledge really limits me. And watching tutorials are
            helpful but sometimes give me slight imposter syndrome. What was
            unfortunate about a section of my JavaScript was the contact form I
            created. It works if the email address is my own, so it won't accept
            anyone elses. But even if I put my own in, I don't get the message.
            I think it's got to do with a security restriction between Google
            and the SMTP I'm using. So work will need to be done in order to get
            this properly working.

          <p class="blog-paragraph">
            My best and most meaningful part of this iteration though was the UI
            and UX <a class="hyperlink" href="blog_5_UI.html">reflection.</a> I
            felt I learned a lot from it, especially deepening my understanding
            of both concepts and their important roles and uses. I had to really
            consider where my differences were, and to dig as deep as realising
            the effects the scan's dpi had on the image of the wireframe's
            quality made me feel like I was thinking proactively about nuanced
            aspects of the site.
